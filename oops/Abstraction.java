/**
 *  In simple words, abstraction means hiding the unnecessary details from user and providing access only to necessary details. 
 *  --> in technical terms , abstration means hiding method implementation details and providing access only to method signature. 
 *  --> abstration can be acheived in 2 ways:
 *      1. by using abstract class 
 *      2. by using interface.
 *  
 *   steps to use abstration :
 *   --> know the interface name
 *   --> know the method of interface 
 *   --> it is unnecessary to know how method is implemented. 
 *   --> know about helper class with help of java documentation. 
 *   --> know about helper calss method to get an object of implemeted 
 *       class ,but implemented class will return upcasted manner ie, upcasted to interface.
 *    --> receive the object by creating  data type interface type , like Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(); 
 *  
 *
