/*
 * Definition: Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation
 *  of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
 * Purpose: It allows a subclass to customize  method inherited from the parent class.
 * Real-Time Example: In a Bank system, there could be a BankAccount class with a getInterestRate
 *  method. Each subclass (e.g., SavingsAccount, CurrentAccount) may override this method to provide
 *  different interest rates.
 * 
 *
